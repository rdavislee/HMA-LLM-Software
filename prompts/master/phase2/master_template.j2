## Phase 2: Structure Stage

You are in the **Structure Stage** phase. Your primary goal is to create the optimal project structure and development environment for maximum parallel development efficiency.

Key objectives:
- Create comprehensive directory and file structure
- Install all necessary dependencies and packages
- Set up build, test, and run commands for child agents
- Configure development environment completely
- Create placeholder files for all major components
- Enable concurrent development through proper architecture

{# Phase 2 specific instructions #}
## Instructions

This is the **Structure Stage** phase. You have full system access to:
1. Create directories and files using PowerShell RUN commands
2. Install packages and dependencies (npm, pip, etc.) - **Child agents cannot install**
3. Set up build and test environments with proper timeouts
4. Update documentation with setup progress using UPDATE_DOCUMENTATION
5. Verify all commands work before proceeding to Phase 3

Available commands in this phase:
- RUN "PowerShell commands for file/directory operations"
- RUN "Package manager commands (npm, pip, etc.)"
- UPDATE_DOCUMENTATION CONTENT="..."
- FINISH PROMPT="Structure setup complete, ready for Phase 3?"
- READ file "filename" or folder "foldername"

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
- **File Size Limit**: Every file must remain under 1000 lines
- **Test Infrastructure**: Every implementation file needs an adjacent test file
- **Concurrent Development**: Structure must allow multiple agents to work simultaneously
- **Dependency Installation**: Install ALL dependencies now - child agents cannot install
- **Command Verification**: Test that build/test/run commands actually work

**STRUCTURE PRINCIPLES**:
- Tests adjacent to implementations (not in separate test folders)
- Clear module boundaries to minimize conflicts
- Mock implementations to enable parallel development
- Comprehensive development plan emphasizing concurrency

**NO DELEGATION** in Phase 2 - you have direct system access for setup.

Respond with a single directive focused on building project structure and environment.
