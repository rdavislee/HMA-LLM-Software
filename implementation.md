# Hierarchical Multi-Agent LLM Software Construction System

## Problem Statement

API costs become prohibitively expensive when using coding agents in large software construction projects due to rapidly expanding context windows. As context windows grow larger, AI performance degrades significantly, making it impossible to complete entire software construction projects in a single prompt. This creates a fundamental scalability barrier for AI-assisted software development.

## Solution Overview

This system implements a **Hierarchical Multi-Agent LLM Software Construction Framework** that mirrors the structure of a GitHub repository. The solution utilizes chain-of-thought LLM concepts and a hierarchical agent structure to decompose large software construction tasks into smaller, manageable components that can be completed efficiently with minimal context windows.

## Core Architecture

### Agent Hierarchy Structure

The system creates a virtual development team where each component of the codebase has a dedicated agent:

- **Manager Agents**: Control directories and coordinate work within their scope
- **Coder Agents**: Handle individual files and implement specific functionality
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Agent structure mirrors the folder structure, creating natural boundaries and responsibilities

### Agent Lifecycle and State Management

Each agent operates with the following lifecycle:

1. **Inactive State**: Agent exists but is not processing tasks
2. **Active State**: Agent is actively working on a delegated task
3. **Delegating State**: Manager agent is distributing tasks to children
4. **Waiting State**: Manager agent is waiting for child completion
5. **Completion State**: Agent has finished its task and reports results

**State Management**:
- Agents maintain a "memory" dictionary mapping filenames to file paths
- Context history stores prompt-response pairs for API call tracking
- Personal files: Managers maintain README files, coders manage their assigned code files
- Task queues handle multiple pending prompts efficiently

### Communication Protocol

Agents communicate through a structured hierarchical protocol:

**Message Types**:
- `DELEGATION`: Parent → Child (task assignment with context)
- `RESULT`: Child → Parent (completion status and output)

**Message Structure**:
```typescript
interface TaskMessage {
  message_type: "delegation"
  sender: Any  // Agent object that sent this message
  recipient: Any  // Agent object that should receive this message
  timestamp: number
  message_id: string
  task: {
    task_id: string
    task_string: string  // English description
  }
}

interface ResultMessage {
  message_type: "result"
  sender: Any  // Agent object that sent this message
  recipient: Any  // Agent object that should receive this message
  timestamp: number
  message_id: string
  task: Task
  result: string  // English description of completion
}
```

## Domain-Specific Languages

### Manager Language

Manager agents use a specialized language for coordination and delegation:

**Core Directives**:
- `CREATE file/folder "path"` - Create new files or directories
- `DELETE file/folder "path"` - Remove files or directories
- `READ file/folder "path"` - Read file contents or list directory
- `DELEGATE file/folder "path" PROMPT="task description"` - Assign work to child agents
- `WAIT` - Pause execution until children complete
- `FINISH PROMPT="completion message"` - Mark task completion
- `UPDATE_README CONTENT_STRING="content"` - Maintain agent documentation
- `RUN "command"` - Execute terminal commands (limited scope)

**Concurrency Control**:
- Independent tasks can be delegated simultaneously for parallel execution
- Interdependent tasks are delegated sequentially
- `WAIT` directive allows managers to pause until specific children complete
- Managers can re-task completed children or assign new work

### Coder Language

Coder agents use a specialized language for code generation and file management:

**Core Directives**:
- `READ "filename"` - Read any file in the codebase for context
- `RUN "command"` - Execute terminal commands (primarily for testing)
- `CHANGE CONTENT="new file contents"` - Replace entire file contents
- `FINISH PROMPT="completion message"` - Report task completion

**File Ownership**:
- Each coder agent owns exactly one file and can only modify that file
- Agents can read any file in the codebase for dependencies and context
- Complete file replacement ensures atomic operations

## Technical Implementation

### Agent Classes

**BaseAgent** (Abstract Base Class):
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self, path: str, parent: Optional[BaseAgent] = None)
    def activate(self, task: TaskMessage) -> None
    def deactivate(self) -> None
    def process_task(self, prompt: str) -> None
    async def api_call(self) -> None  # Abstract method
    def read_file(self, file_path: str) -> None
    def get_context_string(self) -> str
    def get_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

**ManagerAgent** (extends BaseAgent):
```python
class ManagerAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, path: str, children: List[BaseAgent] = None)
    def delegate_task(self, child: BaseAgent, task_description: str) -> None
    def receive_child_result(self, child: BaseAgent, result: Any) -> None
    async def api_call(self) -> None  # Processes manager language
```

**CoderAgent** (extends BaseAgent):
```python
class CoderAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, path: str, parent: Optional[BaseAgent] = None)
    async def api_call(self) -> None  # Processes coder language
```

### Context Management

**Context Window Optimization**:
- Maximum context depth: 3 levels (configurable)
- Default max context size: 8000 tokens (configurable)
- Context includes: codebase structure, relevant file contents, task history
- Memory management: Agents "forget" context upon task completion

**Context Sharing**:
- Full codebase structure available to all agents
- File contents cached in agent memory during active state
- Parent agents can pass relevant context to children
- Documentation folder accessible to all agents

### File System Interface

**Permissions and Safety**:
- Agents can read any file in the codebase
- Agents can only modify their assigned personal file
- File operations are atomic and safe
- Directory structure changes require manager agent permissions

**Interface-First Development**:
- Agents produce TypeScript interfaces before implementations
- Separate interface and implementation files
- Enables concurrent development and early integration
- Reduces context window requirements for dependent agents

## Development Workflow

### Test-First Programming Wave Pattern

The system implements a sophisticated wave-based development process:

**Phase 1: Specification Wave (Down)**
1. Root manager delegates interface specification tasks
2. Wave propagates down the src/ hierarchy
3. Each coder agent creates TypeScript interfaces for their module
4. Wave returns to root after all specs are complete

**Phase 2: Test Suite Wave (Down)**
1. Root manager delegates test creation tasks
2. Wave propagates down the test/ hierarchy
3. Each coder agent creates test suites based on interfaces
4. Wave returns to root after all tests are complete

**Phase 3: Implementation Wave (Down)**
1. Root manager delegates implementation tasks
2. Wave propagates down the src/ hierarchy
3. Each coder agent implements functionality using tests as guides
4. Wave returns to root after all implementations are complete

**Phase 4: Iteration**
- Process repeats until all tests pass and functionality is complete
- Failed tests trigger new implementation waves
- Interface changes trigger new test waves

### Concurrent Development Strategy

**Independent Task Parallelization**:
- Manager agents analyze task dependencies
- Independent tasks delegated simultaneously
- Dependent tasks delegated sequentially
- Wait/retask mechanisms for coordination

**Context Sharing Optimization**:
- Shared interfaces enable early integration
- Documentation folder provides common knowledge base
- Parent agents pass relevant context to children
- Memory management prevents context bloat
