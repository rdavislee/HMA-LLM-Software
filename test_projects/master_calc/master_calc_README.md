# Sympy Calculator Project

This project aims to build a standalone Windows executable for an advanced mathematical calculator using Python, Tkinter, and SymPy.

## Directories
- src/ - [BEGUN] Contains the core application source code, including the calculation engine and GUI. Phase 1 (Engine) is complete, but Phase 2 (GUI with mocked tests) requires further verification or work to ensure headless test compatibility.
- scratch_pads/ - [NOT STARTED] Temporary files for experimentation.
- venv/ - [FINISHED] Python virtual environment setup.

## Files
- documentation.md - [FINISHED] Project vision, architecture, UI flow, core features, and development plan.
- master_calc_README.md - [FINISHED] Top-level project README.
