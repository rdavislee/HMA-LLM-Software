# Physics Engine Module

This module is responsible for simulating the 2D physics of creatures using Pymunk, including joint and muscle dynamics, and interactions with the ground.

## Files
- pymunk_engine.py - [FINISHED] Pymunk-based 2D physics engine for creature simulation, refactored for `space.on_collision` and improved ground contact, now addressing internal joint collisions, ground radius, and high-velocity ground penetration.
- pymunk_engine_test.py - [FINISHED] Comprehensive test suite for the Pymunk physics engine, now rigorously testing ground penetration and updated for ground radius.
