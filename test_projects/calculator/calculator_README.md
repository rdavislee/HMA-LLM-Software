## Status

Initial project structure is set up. Core modules (expression, parser, utils) are present in source and test directories, but their implementation and testing status needs to be verified. The main 'calculator' module itself is not yet fully defined or implemented. The next steps will involve compiling the existing TypeScript, testing the current modules, and then defining and implementing the core calculator functionality.
