This directory contains the implementation of a calculator object, including its interface, core logic, and comprehensive test suite. The project is structured with source files in src/ and tests in test/. This manager agent is responsible for coordinating the development of the calculator, ensuring test-first development, and maintaining clear documentation of file status.

File Status:
- src/calculator.interface.ts: unimplemented - needs interface for basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and exponentiation (power). This task will be delegated to the 'src' folder agent.
- src/calculator.ts: unimplemented - will contain the calculator logic.
- test/calculator.test.ts: unimplemented - will contain tests for the calculator.
