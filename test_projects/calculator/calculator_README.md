# Calculator Object Implementation

## Status

- `src/calculator.interface.ts`: specs complete
- `src/calculator.ts`: specs complete, tests complete, implementation *needs re-evaluation* (division by zero fix applied, but tests indicate it still throws an error instead of returning `Infinity`/`NaN`)
- `package.json`: configured for Mocha testing
- `test/calculator.test.ts`: tests converted to Mocha syntax and confirmed compatible. The `npm test` failure is due to `src/calculator.ts`'s `divide` method throwing an error on division by zero, contrary to test expectations.

Current task: Update tests to use Mocha, then ensure implementation is correct by running them. Progress is blocked by `src/calculator.ts` needing a re-fix for the `divide` method's division by zero handling.
