Status
Core calculus functions (evaluate, derivate, integrate definite, integrate indefinite) in src/expression.ts and src/utils.ts are now complete. `src/utils.ts` fully supports indefinite integration for `e^u` (including forms like `e^x` and `e^(ax)`) and `a^x` (including numeric and constant bases like `pi^x`). All related tests in `test/utils.test.ts` are passing.
