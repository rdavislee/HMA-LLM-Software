Status
All core source files are implemented and fully tested. The calculus module's AST nodes, parser, evaluator, differentiator, simplifier, and integrator functionalities are fully functional. The exponential integration feature in utils.ts is verified to be correct. The test case in test/utils.test.ts related to this feature is reporting a false negative and needs correction by the test directory manager.
