Autonomous Agent Framework
Concept
This project explores a new approach to AI-assisted software development by creating a hierarchy of specialized agents that mirror how human development teams organize around a codebase.

The Core Idea
In traditional AI coding assistants, a single AI helps with one file or task at a time. This project instead creates a "virtual development team" where:

Each folder in a project has a manager agent responsible for coordinating work within that folder
Each file has a coder agent responsible for implementing that specific file
Agents communicate with each other to share context and coordinate work
Multiple agents can work on different parts of the codebase simultaneously
How It Works
Imagine you ask the system to "build a blog application." The root manager agent would understand this requires several components - maybe a database module, an API module, and a frontend. It would then delegate these high-level tasks to manager agents responsible for each major folder.

Those managers would further break down the work. The API manager might realize it needs user authentication, post management, and comment handling. It would create tasks for the appropriate file-level agents to implement these features.

Throughout this process, agents can read any file in the codebase to understand the full context, but they can only modify files within their assigned scope. This prevents conflicts while allowing agents to make informed decisions.

Key Principles
Hierarchical Organization: The agent structure mirrors the folder structure. This creates natural boundaries and responsibilities.

Concurrent Development: Since agents can't modify files outside their scope, multiple agents can work simultaneously without conflicts.

Efficient Context Sharing: When a manager agent reads important information (like the database schema), it can pass this context to its children, avoiding redundant work.

Autonomous Decision Making: Each agent decides for itself when it needs more information, when it's ready to implement something, or when it needs clarification.

Why This Matters
Current AI coding tools require constant human guidance and work on one piece at a time. This approach could enable AI to tackle entire features or even complete applications with minimal human intervention, while maintaining code organization and consistency.

The hierarchical structure also makes the system's decisions more interpretable - you can see which agent made which choice and why, similar to how you might review work in a human development team.

Project Status
This is an experimental research project exploring whether this multi-agent approach can produce better results than traditional single-agent systems. The repository contains experiments, prototypes, and learnings from building this system.
