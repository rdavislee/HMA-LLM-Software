Feedback on base agent implementation, in order of the file.

More documentation on the rep, ex what is the children dictionary str key supposed to be?

I assume context cache will be where active agents store their calls from while they have been active?

Since each agent will have one file they can alter, this file should be a part of the rep. For coders, their path and their file will be the same. For managers, they will not, since their path is to their folder and their readme will belong to the folder containing their folder.

The children directory should only be a possible rep for a manager agent, not all agents. All functions that involve sending messages to children should be manager only.

Activate needs to have checks that the agent is not already active.

GET RID OF WRITE_FILE! The core idea is that each agent will have a personal file that is their only content space. Managers have their readmes, coders have their code files. See my comment about the readme function. Copy pasted here: I think that we could have an update file function with an str parameter and it will use the personal file attribute instead of a file parameter to find the file it is updating. This file will always be included in the context string.

Delete file should be manager agent only.

Terminal operations are good. Allowed commands should be a global constant, so that it can be added to the context string for all agents.

Message queue is good, allows for concurrent children to return messages and not be ignored, message processing should be done in the order they come in.

Delegate task needs to be able to delegate many tasks at once. Parameter should be a dictionary of child_ids to task messages, and this should return void (or None). Furthermore, since you have decided to go with the activate/deactivated agent structure, we need a rep of children (which you have) and we need a rep of active children. Then, delegate should check that the child being delegated isn't already active. Parents must wait until their child is done with a previous task before retasking them.

Send result needs to have many checks to make sure it isnt illegally finishing with active children and needs to deactivate itself.

Load context is going to need to be broader than just the readme since coders have files, not readmes. Overall structure is good. Should only be called upon activation.

For get codebase structure, we really need this to output a string representation of the codebase that an LLM could understand. Perhaps this could be handled with a context to string converter function. Are you expecting Davis to implement the context to string system in phase 4? If so, this is fine, especially since context is a rep.

I don't think we should have an update readme function that prompts the agent for a readme. Also, only manager agents will have personal readmes, coder agents will be able to do the same function through commenting their file. So I think that we could have an update file function with an str parameter and it will use the personal file attribute instead of a file parameter to find the file it is updating. This file will always be included in the context string.

Add child and remove child are good.

Get status is good, will need to be updated as we change.
